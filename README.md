# Save Editor for [Game Name] ‚Äî Final Release

## üß≠ Why This Project Is Archived

Since this tool‚Äôs release:
- A newer save editor has become available with full `.sav` support
- It includes more complete mappings and better cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux)
- Given that, this project is no longer being updated

This repo is preserved for historical and educational purposes.
